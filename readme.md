# Welcome to Kat's BTRY 6020 section!

This website is called GitHub. It is used by programmers, computer scientists, and the like to collaborate on on software and share open source projects. For this class, I will be using it as a convenient place to dump stuff that I go over in lab which is not in the lab handouts, as well as code that I write which is different from the code in the lab handout. Basically, my idea with this repository is to have a place where y'all can have one stop shopping for any of the useful stuff I dredge up or come up with on my own. 

## What are the files in this repository?
