# Welcome to Kat's BTRY 6020 section!

This website is called GitHub. It is used by programmers, computer scientists, and the like to collaborate on on software and share open source projects. For this class, I will be using it as a convenient place to dump stuff that I go over in lab which is not in the lab handouts, as well as code that I write which is different from the code in the lab handout. Basically, my idea with this repository is to have a place where y'all can have one stop shopping for any of the useful stuff I dredge up or come up with on my own. 

## What are the files in this repository? 

There are a couple of special files in this repository: 

* `.gitignore`: this is a list of files that GitHub is not keeping track of. Don't worry about this file. 
* `Labs.Rproj`: this is the RStudio Project file for this repository. RStudio Projects are a helpful way of organizing the directories you use for R programming, and are helpful when working with GitHub. They will not be necessary for you to know about for this class for now, and probably will not be required at any poihnt. However, if you're curious, [this blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/01/rstudio-projects-and-working-directories-a-beginners-guide/) can tell you more about them. 
* `readme.md`: you're reading this one right now!

As the course goes on, I plan to add more code to this repository for easy reference. `.R` files are R code files, and `.Rmd` files are RMarkdown files. There will likely be pdf files associated with the .Rmd files, but I may also add those to the `.gitignore` so that they do not end up on this repository, in which case you would need to copy and paste the file into your computer and knit it to see the pdf output.
